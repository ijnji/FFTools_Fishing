FFTools_Fishing
===============

A simple fishing automation tool for FFXIVARR (v2014.09.11).

This is for educational purposes only.  
This was made as an experiment and to help me learn more about development.
I don't encourage long-term use of bots.

- Compile in Windows using cmd.
$ csc.exe FFTools_MemoryManager.cs FFTools_Fishing.cs
