FFTools_Fishing
===============

A simple fishing bot for FFXIVARR (v2014.09.11).

This is for educational purposes only.  
This was made as an experiment and to help me learn more about development.
I don't encourage long-term use of bots.

How to use
==========
- Make sure the .NET 4 framework is installed.

- Compile in Windows using cmd.exe.
>`$ csc.exe FFTools_MemoryManager.cs FFTools_Fishing.cs`

- Make sure FFIXARR is running and you're in-game.

- Run from cmd.exe.
>`$ FFTools_Fishing.exe`
