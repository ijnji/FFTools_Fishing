FFTools_Fishing
===============

A simple fishing bot for FFXIVARR (v2014.09.11).

This is for educational purposes only.  
This was made as an experiment and to help me learn more about development.
I don't encourage the long-term use of bots.

Usage
==========
- Check that version 4 or above .NET is installed.
- Check the keybinds in FFTools_Fishing.cs for "Cast", and "Hook".  By default, "Cast" is "2", and "Hook" is "3".
- Compile in Windows using cmd.exe:

>`$ csc.exe FFTools_MemoryManager.cs FFTools_Fishing.cs`

- Make sure FFIXARR is running and that you're in-game.  Switch to FSH class, and stand at a fish-able location.
- Run from cmd.exe:

>`$ FFTools_Fishing.exe`
